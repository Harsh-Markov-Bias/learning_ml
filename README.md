##Learning OOP in Python — a personal journey

This repo is where I’m tracking my progress as I brush up on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. The idea is to take a hands-on, systematic approach — starting from the basics and gradually moving toward more advanced patterns and practical applications.

Rather than just going through tutorials or notes, I’ll be writing small projects and examples that reflect each concept I’m learning. It’s mainly for my own learning, but if you’re exploring Python OOP yourself, you might find some useful ideas or inspiration here.

Expect this repo to grow over time — it’ll evolve as I dive into things like inheritance, composition, mixins, design patterns, and eventually how these concepts apply in frameworks like Flask or FastAPI.
