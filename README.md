## Learning Journey — From Python Fundamentals to Machine Learning Projects

This is my personal learning repo where I’m systematically improving my understanding of core software engineering concepts and modern machine learning.

My goal is to build a solid foundation — not just in ML algorithms — but in the practical skills needed to create real-world ML systems: writing clean, maintainable code (with strong OOP fundamentals), understanding design patterns and architecture, getting comfortable with Python frameworks, learning how to structure backend services, and finally bringing it all together in complete ML-driven projects.

The repo is not structured as a course or tutorial. It’s simply a way for me to track my progress and organise my learnings — from small examples to larger projects — in a way that I (and maybe others) can refer back to.

If you happen to stumble upon this repo while on a similar path, you’re welcome to explore and use whatever parts you find helpful.
